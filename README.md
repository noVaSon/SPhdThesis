# SPhdThesis: A Latex template for writing Phd Thesis #

SPhdThesis is a latex template (document class) for writing PhD thesis. I forked it from [Saurabh Garg](https://github.com/saurabhg17/SPhdThesis/) to build my own version with my masters thesis in mind. By default, it adheres to the [NUS Guidelines on Format of Research Thesis Submitted For Examination](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/event/gdthesisexam.html "NUS Guidelines on Format of Research Thesis Submitted For Examination") (Link updated on 31/05/2014). However, it is quite easy to change it for a different guideline.

I changed the default bilbliography style to a DIN based one translated to english. Here I want to provide you a kickstart into scientific writing with all gimmicks enabled. It features automatic table of content, figures, source code, backlinks from the bibliography to the page where the citation appeared and of cause internal and external links that are even differentiated by color. It is further possible to lessen the color usage for print in order to save some money. 

I used Texpad on MacOs 12.6 to compile my code to pdf.
Look at CTAN after documentation of specific LateX Packages.

## Getting started ##
The easiest way to start using SPhdThesis is to copy the example folder and start by inspecting and modifying `thesis.tex`. `figure.tex`, `table.tex`, `algorithm.tex` files show how to format figures, tables, and algorithms, respectively. `example\thesis.pdf` is an example of how a thesis looks like using SPhdThesis document class.

For more details read `SPhdThesis.pdf`. It describes in detail how to use the document class and provide some hints on how to customize it. It also lists some useful tools for working with latex.
