This example thesis is meant to introduce you to a few basic commands that you will need to work with latex. Always look at the source code whenever there is some example, because the interesting stuff happens underneath the surface :)

I want to give you a head-start into writing your thesis with latex, because after some initial hurdles you need to take, it can make the formal stuff so much easier, scientifically more sophisticated an your document will be better readable and even smaller in size.

You find examples of pretty much all functionality that I needed when writing my masters thesis. This template is not written by me, but I added some modifications. Make sure to have a look at the .cls file, because this one is well commented and shows you how to quickly manipulate the look of your whole document with just a few arguments and commands.

Enjoy writing!
